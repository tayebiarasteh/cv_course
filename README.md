This project contains the programming exercises of the *Computer Vision* course (SS 2020) offered by the [Pattern Recognition Lab (LME)](https://lme.tf.fau.de/) of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/) at [University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu/).

## Contents

The main goal of the project is to illustrate different algorithms and to try them out in some real-world applications.

#### Overview of the project:

- **Feature Detection**: Harris Corner Response, Corner Detection, Edge Detection.

- **Panorama Stitching**: Including [ORB](http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/orb_final.pdf) Feature Matching using 2-Nearest Neighbor Search with Outlier Removing, a homography that transforms the image plane of one camera
to the image plane of an other camera, and RANSAC algorithm.

- **Stereo Vision**: Patch Match Disparity Maps, and Outlier Removal including Thresholding, Segmentation, Left-Right Consistency Check.

- **Optical Flow**: Lucas-Kanade method for optical flow estimation.

### In progress...
